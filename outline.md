# Functional as a First Paradigm

## Introduction

  - start with personal introduction
    - name, background, place of work
  - talk introduction
    - Today I'm here to talk to you about functional programming
    - This talk is about my personal experience as a junior dev and is totally biased
    - But with that disclaimer let's jump in

  What is a programming paradigm?
  What is a paradigm?
  Programming paradigms

## Assumptions and questions

  1. Your first language is important.
    - sets standard for learning future languages
    - changes thought process
  2. Imperative and OOP languages dominate your early life as a programmer.
    - why is OOP so popular?
     - Reference Joe Armstrong
      1. It was thought to be easier to learn
        - Human readability and nice structure
      2. It was thought to make code reuse easier.
       - Shouldn't an application structured in classes and objects be easier to scale?
        - The harm of state and side effects
        - Inheritance is scary
      3. It was hyped.
        - more coverage
      4. It created a new software industry.
        - more jobs
    - Why is it taught first?
  3. Functional programming could prove to be a better option.
    - What is functional programming?
    - Benefits of functional programming
      1. Human readability
        - counterpoint Lisp
          - dissaudes new programmers from trying functional programming imo
          - why is lisp and scheme taught first?
        - Elixir example
          - dissection of example
            1. pattern matching
            2. crude polymorphism
            3. idempotence
      2. introduction to more concepts
        - ditto
      3. Thinking more about algorithmic composition than state
        - focus is on the core concepts of computer science rather than structuring a program
      4. scalability and modularity
      5. concurrency
  4. How can we change this?
    - Teaching more accessible functional languages than lisp and scheme
    - Structuring academic and bootcamp programs with an OO track and functional track
  5. Can we change this?
    - Probably not
      1. OO dominates the industry
      2. Most jobs are OO
      3. Do people even care enough?
    - But we might
      1. Functional languages are growing in popularity
      2. More and more high traffic companies depending on high concerency (e.g., discord, whatsapp, netflix)

## Closing Remarks
  What do I mean by functional as a first paradigm?
    - I mean to share my experience. It wasn't anything I sought out. I fell into it. I learned Elixir in like 5 days to get my current job.
