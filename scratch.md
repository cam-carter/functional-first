How do we teach programming?

Most universities start you off with an intro to programming course.

The class usually covers the basics of programming in an imperative language, such as C++, Java, or Python.

As a new student to programming, you'll go over variable assigment, basic operands, and function declarations.

Variable assignment: It's always first. x = 1, y = 2. x + y = 3
